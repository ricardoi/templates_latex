	abstract = { Viral metagenomics relies on high-throughput sequencing and on bioinformatic analyses to access the genetic content and diversity of entire viral communities. No universally accepted strategy or tool currently exists to define operational taxonomy units (OTUs) and evaluate viral alpha or beta diversity from virome data. Here we present a new bioinformatic resource, the VirAnnot (automated viral diversity estimation) pipeline, which performs the automated identification of OTUs. Reverse-position-specific BLAST (RPS-Blastn) is used to detect conserved viral protein motifs. The corresponding contigs are then aligned and a clustering approach is used to group in the same OTU contigs sharing more than a set identity threshold. A 10\% threshold has been validated as producing OTUs that reasonably approach, in many families, the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses taxonomy and can therefore be used as a proxy to viral species. },

	abstract = {We report the first identification of novel viruses, and sequence of an entire viral genome, by a single step of high-throughput parallel sequencing of small RNAs from diseased, as well as symptomless plants. Contigs were assembled from sequenced total siRNA from plants using small sequence assembly software and could positively identify RNA, ssDNA and dsDNA reverse transcribing viruses and in one case spanned the entire genome. The results present a novel approach which cannot only identify known viral pathogens, occurring at extremely low titers, but also novel viruses, without the necessity of any prior knowledge.},

@article{doi:10.1094/PHYTO-02-18-0067-R,
	abstract = { Recent developments in high-throughput sequencing (HTS), also called next-generation sequencing (NGS), technologies and bioinformatics have drastically changed research on viral pathogens and spurred growing interest in the field of virus diagnostics. However, the reliability of HTS-based virus detection protocols must be evaluated before adopting them for diagnostics. Many different bioinformatics algorithms aimed at detecting viruses in HTS data have been reported but little attention has been paid thus far to their sensitivity and reliability for diagnostic purposes. Therefore, we compared the ability of 21 plant virology laboratories, each employing a different bioinformatics pipeline, to detect 12 plant viruses through a double-blind large-scale performance test using 10 datasets of 21- to 24-nucleotide small RNA (sRNA) sequences from three different infected plants. The sensitivity of virus detection ranged between 35 and 100\% among participants, with a marked negative effect when sequence depth decreased. The false-positive detection rate was very low and mainly related to the identification of host genome-integrated viral sequences or misinterpretation of the results. Reproducibility was high (91.6\%). This work revealed the key influence of bioinformatics strategies for the sensitive detection of viruses in HTS sRNA datasets and, more specifically (i) the difficulty in detecting viral agents when they are novel or their sRNA abundance is low, (ii) the influence of key parameters at both assembly and annotation steps, (iii) the importance of completeness of reference sequence databases, and (iv) the significant level of scientific expertise needed when interpreting pipeline results. Overall, this work underlines key parameters and proposes recommendations for reliable sRNA-based detection of known and unknown viruses. },

	abstract = { This white paper presents a series of perspectives on current and future phytobiome management, discussed at the Wild and Tamed Phytobiomes Symposium in University Park, PA, U.S.A., in June 2018. To enhance plant productivity and health, and to translate lab- and greenhouse-based phytobiome research to field applications, the academic community and end-users need to address a variety of scientific, practical, and social challenges. Prior discussion of phytobiomes has focused heavily on plant-associated bacterial and fungal assemblages, but the phytobiomes concept covers all factors that influence plant function. Here we discuss various management considerations, including abiotic conditions (e.g., soil and nutrient applications), microorganisms (e.g., bacterial and fungal assemblages, bacterial and fungal inoculants, and viruses), macroorganisms (e.g., arthropods and plant genetics), and societal factors (e.g., communication approaches and technology diffusion). An important near-term goal for this field should be to estimate the potential relative contribution of different components of the phytobiome to plant health, as well as the potential and risk of modifying each in the near future. },

@article{gorbalenya_new_2020,
	abstract = {Virus taxonomy emerged as a discipline in the middle of the twentieth century. Traditionally, classification by virus taxonomists has been focussed on the grouping of relatively closely related viruses. However, during the past few years, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ({ICTV}) has recognized that the taxonomy it develops can be usefully extended to include the basal evolutionary relationships among distantly related viruses. Consequently, the {ICTV} has changed its Code to allow a 15-rank classification hierarchy that closely aligns with the Linnaean taxonomic system and may accommodate the entire spectrum of genetic divergence in the virosphere. The current taxonomies of three human pathogens, Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and herpes simplex virus 1 are used to illustrate the impact of the expanded rank structure. This new rank hierarchy of virus taxonomy will stimulate further research on virus origins and evolution, and vice versa, and could promote crosstalk with the taxonomies of cellular organisms.},

A variety of methods have been employed to study plant virus biodiversity, including enrichment for virus-like particles or virus-specific {RNA} or {DNA}, or the extraction of total nucleic acids, followed by next-generation deep sequencing and bioinformatic analyses. All of the methods have some shortcomings, but taken together these studies reveal our surprising lack of knowledge about plant viruses and point to the need for more comprehensive studies. In addition, many new viruses have been discovered, with most virus infections in wild plants appearing asymptomatic, suggesting that virus disease may be a byproduct of domestication. For plant pathologists these studies are providing useful tools to detect viruses, and perhaps to predict future problems that could threaten cultivated plants.},

These viruses are in the taxonomic family Hypoviridae, which cause hypovirulence of the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria parasitica.The development of hypovirus reverse genetics systems is described.Hypovirus diversity has been exploited to identify symptom determinants and modulate fungal--plant pathogenic interactions.Potentially, mycoviruses could be used to explore the origins, evolution and functions of {RNA} silencing in fungi. These viruses could also be used to probe the signal transduction pathways that underpin fungal pathogenesis.Hypovirus-mediated modulation of the host transcriptome has been analysed using microarrays, which has confirmed hypovirus-mediated alterations of host functions including G-protein signalling, and has revealed a link between mitochondrial and viral hypovirulence.Finally, the prospects for engineering hypoviruses to improve their suitability for biological control of fungal diseases of plants are discussed.},

@article{rumbou_towards_2021,
	abstract = {Thanks to the development of {HTS} technologies, a vast amount of genetic information on the virosphere of temperate forests has been gained in the last seven years. To estimate the qualitative/quantitative impact of {HTS} on forest virology, we have summarized viruses affecting major tree/shrub species and their fungal associates, including fungal plant pathogens, mutualists and saprotrophs. The contribution of {HTS} methods is extremely significant for forest virology. Reviewed data on viral presence in holobionts allowed us a first attempt to address the role of virome in holobionts. Forest health is dependent on the variability of microorganisms interacting with the host tree/holobiont; symbiotic microbiota and pathogens engage in a permanent interplay, which influences the host. Through virus--virus interplays synergistic or antagonistic relations may evolve, which may drastically affect the health of the holobiont. Novel insights of these interplays may allow practical applications for forest plant protection based on endophytes and mycovirus biocontrol agents. The current analysis is conceived in light of the prospect that novel viruses may initiate an emergent infectious disease and that measures for the avoidance of future outbreaks in forests should be considered.},

@article{oladokun_tomato_2019,
	abstract = {Tomato is the most economically important fruit/vegetable crop grown worldwide. However, viral diseases remain an important factor limiting its productivity, with estimated quantitative and qualitative yield losses in tomato crops often reaching up to 100\%. Many viruses infecting tomato have been reported, while new viral diseases have also emerged. The climatic changes the world is experiencing can be a contributing factor to the successful spread of newly emerging viruses, as well as the establishment of disease in areas that were previously either unfavourable or where the disease was absent. Because antiviral products are not available, strategies to mitigate viral diseases rely on genetic resistance/tolerance to infection, control of vectors, improvement in crop hygiene, roguing of infected plants and seed certification. Tomato brown rugose fruit virus ({ToBRFV}) is an emerging viral threat to tomato productivity and is currently spreading into new areas, which is of great concern to the growing global production in the absence of mitigation measures. This review presents the current knowledge about {ToBRFV} and future prospects for an improved understanding of the virus, which will be needed to support effective control and mitigation of the impact it is likely to cause.},

@article{redinbaugh_maize_2018,

The coinfecting viruses act synergistically to result in frequent plant death or severely reduce or negligible yield. Over the past eight years, {MLN} has emerged in sub-Saharan East Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America, with large impacts on smallholder farmers. Factors associated with {MLN} emergence include multiple maize crops per year, the presence of maize thrips (Frankliniella williamsi), and highly susceptible maize crops. Soil and seed transmission of {MCMV} may also play significant roles in development and perpetuation of {MLN} epidemics. Containment and control of {MLN} will likely require a multipronged approach, and more research is needed to identify and develop the best measures.},

They have contributed to our understanding of the central dogma of biology and have been instrumental in the evolutionary success of bacterial pathogens. In contrast to our current understanding of marine viral communities, the soil virome and its function in terrestrial ecosystems has remained relatively understudied. Here, we examine, in a comparative fashion, the knowledge gathered from studies performed in soil versus marine settings. We address the information with respect to the abundance, diversity, ecological significance, and effects of, in particular, bacteriophages on their host's evolutionary trajectories. We also identify the main challenges that soil virology faces and the studies that are required to accompany the current developments in marine settings.},

Here, we introduce the recently adopted comprehensive taxonomy of viruses based on phylogenomic analyses, as applied to the plant virome. We further trace the evolutionary ancestry of distinct plant virus lineages to primordial genetic mobile elements. We discuss the growing evidence of the pivotal role of horizontal virus transfer from invertebrates to plants during the terrestrialization of these organisms, which was enabled by the evolution of close ecological associations between these diverse organisms. It is our hope that the emerging big picture of the formation and global architecture of the plant virome will be of broad interest to plant biologists and virologists alike and will stimulate ever deeper inquiry into the fascinating field of virus--plant coevolution.},
