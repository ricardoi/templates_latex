% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
New free-electron laser and high-harmonic generation x-ray light
  sources are capable of supplying pulses short and intense enough to
  perform resonant nonlinear time-resolved experiments in molecules. Valence electron motions can be triggered impulsively by
  core excitations and monitored with high temporal and spatial
  resolution.  We discuss possible experiments that employ attosecond
  x-ray pulses to probe quantum coherence and correlations of valence
  electrons and holes, rather than the charge density alone, building
  upon the analogy with existing studies of vibrational motions using femtosecond techniques in the visible regime.

\subsection{Time-Domain X-ray Sources and Spectroscopy}

Nonlinear spectroscopy with visible light became feasible soon after
the laser was invented in the 1960's.  When the applied electric
fields are weak compared to those inside an atom or a molecule
($5.14\times 10^{11}$ V/m for an electron or proton
at a distance of 1 $a_o)$, the response and optical
signals are \emph{linear} in the incoming intensities, and reveal some
information about excited states and their transition dipoles through
a two-point correlation function of the dipole operator. At higher field intensities,
a nonlinear response in the induced polarization is
observed, and the resulting signals encode much more information than
the linear response related to higher order multiple-point correlation
functions.\cite{bloembergen_nonlinear_1982,zewail_femtochemistry:_2000}
The development of nonlinear spectroscopy was enabled by progress in laser technology. As pulse durations shortened from picoseconds in
the seventies to femtoseconds in the eighties, they were employed in
increasingly intricate time-resolved probes of molecular excited
states.%  This review describes possible extensions of these techniques facilitated by recent developments of attosecond x-ray pulses.

\subsection{Vibrational vs. Electronic Franck-Condon Factors}
X-ray linear
absorption\cite{Stohr1996,groot_core_2008,santra_concepts_2009} probes
the unoccupied density of states around the resonant core; the jump in
signal intensity as the frequency reaches the first available
unoccupied state is called the \emph{core-edge}.  The low energy
region of the spectrum, x-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES),
is a direct probe of these virtual orbitals weighted by their atomic
core dipole matrix elements.  Higher energy spectral features, the
extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), are created by
backscattering of the photoionized core electron.  A Fourier transform of
this region yields the structure factor of the nuclei surrounding the
resonant
core,\cite{chen_capturing_2001,rehr_theoretical_2000,bressler_ultrafast_2004}
as the tightly bound core-electrons on neighboring atoms have the
largest cross-section for reflecting this photoelectron.%%   X-ray
%% diffraction (off-resonant elastic scattering) with few keV
%% photons solely probes the charge density and can be treated
%% classically.

\subsection{One-Dimensional Impulsive Stimulated Raman; 1D-SXRS}
The first sources of x-ray light were anode targets for cathode rays
in vacuum.\cite{roentgen_new_1896} The high cross-section for x-ray
photon capture in matter, and the short lifetime of the core hole,
meant that modifying traditional laser cavities to create a population
inversion and lasing at x-ray frequencies would be
difficult.\cite{duguay_approaches_1967} Fortunately, synchrotron
radiation, considered an undesired loss in high-energy particle
experiments, was found incredibly useful for performing experiments in
chemistry, biology, and condensed matter
physics.\cite{perlman_synchrotron_1974} These large facilities convert
electron bunch kinetic energy into short, broadband bursts of bright
x-ray radiation.\cite{duke_synchrotron_2009} The intensity and high
frequencies of the photons available at the highly intense XFEL
sources built at DESY, LCLS,\cite{emmap._first_2010}
(e.g. $10^{12}$ photons in 85 attoseconds at frequency 8~keV),\cite{emmap._first_2010}
can generate sequences of pulses suitable for coherent spectroscopy applications.\cite{nugent_coherent_2010} Methods for generating intense $\sim1$ fs pulses with
UV and VUV frequencies have been proposed.\cite{reiter_route_2010}
\begin{eqnarray}
&&E^{\it XR}  =  - 2\sum_{i \in A} {\sum_{j \in B} {( {ij\,{\mid}\, {ij} )} } }  - 2\sum_{i \in A} {\sum_{j \in B} {S_{\it ij} \left[ {2( {V_{\it ij}^A  + G_{\it ij}^A } ) + \sum_{l \in B} {F_{jl}^B S_{\it li} } } \right]} }  \nonumber\\
&&\hspace*{26pt}+ 2\sum_{i \in A} {\sum_{j \in B} {S_{\it ij} \left[ {\sum_{k \in A} {S_{kj} ( {F_{ik}^A  + V_{ik}^B  + {J}_{ik}^B } )}  + S_{\it ij} ( {V_{\it jj}^A  + {J}_{\it jj}^A } ) - \sum_{k \in A} {S_{kj} ( {ik| {\it jj} )} } } \right]} } ,\qquad 
\end{eqnarray}


In a parallel development, tabletop attosecond higher-harmonic
generation (HHG)
\cite{kapteyn_harnessing_2007,krausz_attosecond_2009,worner_attosecond_2011,hentschel_attosecond_2001,popmintchev_attosecond_2010}
sources provide an alternative to the XFEL. These generate pulses of
high frequency light through a process where a weakly bound electron
in the molecule is ionized, then accelerated back towards the molecule
as the driving field changes phase.
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\hspace*{-30pt}V_{\it mi}^{\it XR}  =  - \sum_{j \in B} {( {mj} \,{\mid}\, {ij} )}  - \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j \in B} {S_{\it mj} \left[ {2( {V_{\it ij}^A  + G_{\it ij}^A } ) + \sum_{l \in B} {F_{jl}^B S_{\it li} } } \right]}  \nonumber\\
&&- \frac{1}{2}\sum_{j \in B} {\left[ {2( {V_{\it mj}^A  + G_{\it mj}^A } ) + \sum_{l \in B} {F_{jl}^B S_{lm} } } \right]} \nonumber \\
&&- \sum_{k \in A} {\sum_{j \in B} {S_{kj} \left[ {4( {kj\,{\mid}\, {mi} ) - ( {km\,{\mid}\, {ji} ) - } ( {ki\,{\mid}\, {jm} )} } } \right]} } \nonumber \\
&&+ \sum_{j \in B} {S_{\it mj} \left[ {\sum_{k \in A} {S_{kj} ( {F_{ik}^A  + V_{ik}^B  + {J}_{ik}^B } ) - ( {ik\,{\mid}\, {\it jj} ) + S_{\it ij} ( {V_{\it jj}^A  + {J}_{\it jj}^A } )} } } \right]} \nonumber \\
&&+ \sum_{j \in B} {S_{\it ij} } \left[ {\sum_{k \in A} {S_{kj} ( {F_{mk}^A  + V_{mk}^B  + {J}_{mk}^B } ) - ( {mk\,{\mid}\, {\it jj} )} } } \right]\nonumber \\
&&+ \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n \in A} {\sum_{k \in A} {\sum_{j \in B} {S_{kj} S_{nj} \left[ {4 ( {nk\,{\mid}\, im} ) - ( {nm\,{\mid}\, ik} ) - ( {ni\,{\mid}\, mk} )} \right]} } }%  + 2\sum_{k \in A} {\sum_{j \in B} {S_{kj}^2 ( {jj\,{\mid}\, mi} ),} }  
\end{eqnarray}
The photoelectron has two chances to recombine with the hole it leaves
behind for each cycle of the field, leading to a highly nonlinear
frequency doubling process capable of generating very high frequency
components which can be recombined to form attosecond pulses.
Ultrafast pulses with central frequency $\sim 800$~eV and $\sim$700~eV
bandwidths were recently reported, potentially yielding 2.5~as Fourier
transform limited pulse after
compression.\cite{popmintchev_bright_2012,bourzac_tabletop_2012} %% HHG

\section{SPONTANEOUS VS. STIMULATED X-RAY RAMAN TECHNIQUES}


\subsection{Frequency-Domain Spontaneous Raman; RIXS}

Spectroscopic techniques have historically built upon earlier technological
advances in lower frequency regimes.  Optical
techniques had benefited from the vast experience in nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) spectroscopy which uses radio waves to study
spins, where the pulse technology had existed since the
forties. Similarly, the emerging x-ray studies could draw upon the
analogy with advances made in the eighties in the visible and the infrared
regimes.
\begin{eqnarray*}
&\displaystyle F_{ik}^A  + V_{ik}^A  + {J}_{ik}^B  \approx F_{ik}^A  + V_{ik}^{ES,B}  \approx F_{ik}^A  + V_{ik}^{\it EFP,B} ,\\
&\displaystyle (ik\,{\mid}\, {\it jj}) \approx ( {i\,{\mid}\, (r_1  - R_{j} )^{ - 1} \,{\mid}\, k} ) = V_{ik}^j ,\\
&\displaystyle V_{\it jj}^A  = \sum_{j \in B} {\sum_{I \in A} {\frac{{ - Z_I }}{{R_{jI} }}} } .
\end{eqnarray*}
The current status of ultrafast x-ray studies is reminiscent
of the early days of nonlinear optical
spectroscopy.\cite{bucksbaum_chapter_2011} Coherent attosecond
pulses\cite{walmsley_characterization_2009} offer a new set of tools
to the experimenter, which allow the direct real-time study of core and valence
excitations.\cite{adams_nonlinear_2003} The detailed
information gained regarding electron correlations and their response to
impulsive perturbations may serve as experimental tests of many-body
theory.  In principle, time-domain techniques provide the same
information as their frequency domain counterparts; the two are connected by multidimensional Fourier transforms.\cite{Mukamel1995}  However,
ultrafast signals may be interpreted intuitively in
terms of wavepacket evolution, and pulsed experiments can be designed to
reveal desired information, which in many cases is highly averaged and hard to extract in
the frequency domain.\cite{zewail_femtochemistry:_2000}
Multidimensional time-domain signals, obtained in response to sequences of impulsive temporally well-separated pulses, probe the correlation between
dynamical events occurring during different controlled interpulse delays by observing spins (NMR),
vibrations (optical and infrared), or valence and core electrons (x-rays).\cite{mukamel_coherent_2009} This review focuses on possible applications of
multidimensional all-x-ray time-domain techniques towards the study of valence excitations in
molecules.

\subsection{Nonlinear X-ray Spectroscopy}

Nonlinear effects in the x-ray regime have long been observed in the
frequency domain,\cite{adams_nonlinear_2003} including parametric
down-conversion,\cite{danino_parametric_1981,freund_parametric_1969,yoda_x-ray_1998,adams_parametric_2000}
hard x-ray frequency doubling,\cite{nazarkin_nonlinear_2003} and
two-photon x-ray fluorescence.\cite{freund_nonlinear_1972} X-ray
parametric down-conversion has been used to visualize  valence
charge motion in optically excited
diamond.\cite{tamasaku_visualizing_2011}  Two-photon
x-ray emission from inner-core states were some of the first nonlinear x-ray processes to be treated
theoretically.\cite{bannett_two-photon_1982} The x-ray/optical
stimulated Raman process was predicted.
\cite{arya_microscopic_1974,hudis_xray_1994,freund_surface_1973}



\subsection{Direct Observation of Core Excitations by X-ray Four-Wave Mixing}
Synchrotron radiation sources have
vastly increased the quality of protein crystallography measurements
using x-ray diffraction.\cite{deisenhofer_structure_1985} The high
intensity of the XFEL sources allows to collect x-ray diffraction
from a single-molecule in response to a single pulse. This enables
structure determination without making crystals.\cite{chapman_femtosecond_2011} Time-dependent x-ray diffraction
(TDXD) can measure the nonequilibrium change in the charge density
triggered by interaction with a visible pump pulse.\cite{bargheer_coherent_2004,elsaesser_transient_2012} The three
decade gap between the early theoretical papers on
TDXD\cite{freund_optically_1970,eisenberger_mixing_1971,woo_inelastic_1972,freund_nonlinear_1972a}
and the experimental measurement of
phonon\cite{lindenberg_time-resolved_2000} and
polariton\cite{cavalleri_tracking_2006} dynamics in solids gives some
indication of the experimental difficulties associated with this
technique. TDXD has been used to measure the ultrafast melting of a
metal after excitation with a laser
pulse.\cite{chen_time-resolved_2011} In the past decade, picosecond
Time-resolved EXAFS has
been used to measure vibrational and valence electronic dynamics in
photoactive inorganic complexes.\cite{bressler_ultrafast_2004}
In constrast to diffraction, resonant attosecond x-ray pulses can
prepare coherent superpositions of core and valence states; revealing
a qualitatively higher level of information about orbitals and spatial
coherence that goes beyond the charge density.\footnote{An alternative ladder diagram approach is based on the many-body density matrix (rather than the wave function) and only requires forward evolution, which is more intuitive. However, for many-body problems the wave-function approach is much more practical, at the price of having to deal with backward evolution.}  A detailed theoretical
description of valence particle and hole propagation in atoms and
molecules showed that ultrafast charge motion driven by electronic
interactions accompanies a sudden perturbation of the ground state
charge
density. \cite{breidbach_universal_2005}

\section{CONTROL PARAMETERS IN X-RAY NONLINEAR SPECTROSCOPIES}

\subsection{Wavevectors and Phases of the Applied Pulses}

Intense x-ray pulses trigger a complex cascade of core-excitations and
Auger decays in atomic targets.\cite{young_femtosecond_2010,doumy_nonlinear_2011} XFEL pulses
are intense enough to create double-core hole states in
molecular nitrogen,\cite{fang_double_2010} and to ionize the tightly bound core-orbitals leading to a
rate-limiting step of Auger decay in the photoionization .\cite{hoener_ultraintense_2010} Double-core hole Auger
electron spectroscopy in $\textrm{N}_2$ has also been
performed.\cite{cryan_auger_2010} 
Time-domain pump-probe measurements were carried
out.\cite{glownia_time-resolved_2010}.  Experiments on the M-edge of
krypton atoms were used to quantify the core lifetime with
subfemtosecond precision,\cite{drescher_time-resolved_2002} and to
measure real-time valence electron motion by an EUV probe of a
molecule photoionized by a NIR pulse.\cite{goulielmakis_real-time_obs}

  The corresponding traces from the OON (dashed, blue) technique deomonstrate
 the effect of changing the probe pulse in the three-pulse
  sequence.}\label{fig:nma-2DRamanNNN}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Detecting Multiple Core Holes by Double-Quantum-Coherence Four Wave Mixing}
HHG sources have been used to study vibrational motions in
$\textrm{N}_2\textrm{O}_2$\cite{li_time-resolved_2008,li_visualizing_2010}
and dynamic bond-breaking in
$\textrm{NO}_2^+$.\cite{zhou_probing_2012} The photoelectron generated in the course of an
HHG process can also be used to investigate the molecular ion through
an interferometric process, a kind of stimulated electron
spectroscopy.\cite{zhou_molecular_2008} The high intensity of the XFEL
sources, and the precision of the HHG sources are
complementary. Electromagnetically induced transparency~\cite{buth_electromagnetically_2007}
studies at x-ray frequencies have
recently led to experiments\cite{rohlsberger_electromagnetically_2012}
which offer the possibility of augmenting the precision of the weaker
HHG pulses with the stronger XFEL radiation, allowing strong and
coherent pulses to be generated.


\subsection{Spectroscopy with Quantum or Stochastic fields}
X-ray signals involve single particle, field-driven transitions
between core and valence electronic orbitals and the many-body valence
response to a transiently created
core-hole.\cite{gadzuk_core_1987,rohringer_x-ray_2007,glownia_time-resolved_2010}
Pump-probe and stimulated Raman were among the very first nonlinear
techniques employed with visible
light.\cite{p.m._direct_1968,eckhardt_stimulated_1962,penzkofer_high_1979}
These signals are robust since they do not require any phase control,
and the detection is simple.  We first focus on all-x-ray stimulated
Raman experiments in which the pump and probe pulses both have x-ray
frequencies.  We then discuss more elaborate four wave mixing
techniques.

\section{OPTICAL RAMAN OF VIBRATIONS VS. X-RAY RAMAN OF ELECTRONS}

To set the stage for x-ray Raman, we first briefly survey some key features of the Raman
technique in the visible.  In both regimes the relevant molecular states form two bands
denoted $g$ and $e.$  The energy gap between the bands is much larger than the intraband
splittings.  In vibrational spectroscopy, the states $g$ and $g'$ ($e$ and $e'$)
represent vibrational states in the ground (excited) electronic state.
In the case of core spectroscopy $g,g'$ are valence excitations whereas $e,e'$ are core excited states.
Raman spectroscopy and infrared absorption
have long been used to study the vibrational states of molecules,
aggregates,\cite{glatzel_electronic_2004} and
materials.\cite{icors2010}

\subsection{Means of Detection: Photons vs. Photoelectrons}

X-ray fields ionize the molecule, and the
ejected electrons' energies and angular properties can be
resolved. %\cite{stolow_femtosecond_2004,stolow_femtosecond_2003}
Pairing the x-ray pulse with an actinic optical pump that prepares
the molecule in a nonequilibrium state can result in other types of
multidimensional signals.


\subsection{Pulse Shaping: Intrapulse Phase Control}
Pulse shaping controls the amplitude and
phase of various modes of the field, written as $\varepsilon(\omega) e^{i \phi(\omega)}.$  Pulse
shaping\cite{walmsley_characterization_2009}
may be used to optimize the nonlinear optical and Raman signals and
highlight desired features. The experimental difficulties
for x-ray pulse-shaping are daunting, but technological progress in
this area is proceeding very rapidly.  The
expression for the effective polarizability given in Eq. \ref{eq:sxrstime2}
 can be easily extended to cover the possibility that the
upward and downward transitions are facilitated by different coincident pulses.
In the optical domain,  much success has
been made by using a narrowband pulse to electronically excite the
system, which is then de-excited by a broadband pulse.%%  Another

\section{CHARGE TRANSFER}
Although Mulliken (83) long ago used theory to anticipate the importance of ground state CT in intermolecular interactions, it now appears that electron delocalization may play an even more widespread role in aqueous chemistry than previously suspected (84). Ion-water CT (85--92) and the affinity of ions for aqueous interfaces (130--133), as well as the influence of ion-water and electron-water interactions on spectroscopy, biocatalysis, and nanoengineering (134--138), are subjects of intense current interest. However, despite multiple studies, the magnitude and importance of ion-water CT remain subjects of significant controversy. The intrinsic connection between CT and polarization makes the analysis of the CT interactions ambiguous. Consequently, formulations of CT range from those in which CT is considered to be an artificial term arising from incompleteness of the basis set to those, like natural bond analysis (139, 140), in which CT plays a predominant role in intermolecular binding. It is also unclear at present whether CT may be included as a stabilizing energy term or whether the actual transfer of charge is required for quantitative prediction of structure and dynamics at interfaces (86, 88, 92, 141). New fundamental studies of the origins of bonding in terms of the components discussed here will hopefully shed some light on this important problem (142).

\subsection{Two-Dimensional impulsive stimulated Raman; 2D-SXRS}
2D-SXRS extends 1D-SXRS by adding one more pulse
(Fig. \ref{fig3}).  Two dimensional correlation plots are
generated by varying the two interpulse delays $t_1$ and $t_2$.
During these delays the system is in a coherence either between a
valence-excited state and the ground state, or between different
valence-excited states.

\begin{marginnote}
\entry{SXRS}{stimulated Raman spectroscopy}
\end{marginnote}

The 2D-SXRS signal is described by the four loop diagrams shown in
Fig. \ref{fig4} which result in the following expression for the signal:
\begin{equation}
S_{2D-SXRS}(\Omega_1,\Omega_2)= \int_{0}^\infty dt_1  \int_{0}^\infty dt_2  e^{i \Omega_1 t_1+i \Omega_2 t_2}S_{2D-SXRS}(t_1,t_2),
\end{equation}
Eq. \ref{eq:polexpansion} contains interfering contributions of various forward and backward
evolution periods.  In diagram $iii$, for example, we first excite
with $\alpha_2$ (``first'' is along the loop, not in real time!),
creating the state $\alpha_2 \vert g_o \rangle$, propagate forward for
$t_2$ ($G(t_2)$), then act with $\alpha_3$, propagate backward for
$t_1+t_2$ ($G^{\dagger}(t_1+t_2)$), and finally project the valence
wavepacket into $\langle g_o \vert \alpha_1^\dagger$.  The other terms can be described
similarly.


Eq. \ref{eq:sxrstime2} may alternatively be recast in the
Schr\"{o}dinger picture as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:sxrstime2}
  S_{\textrm{1D}}(t_1) = \Re \left[\langle\alpha_2 G(t_1)\alpha_1 \rangle - \langle \alpha^\dagger_1 G^\dagger(t_1) \alpha_2\rangle\right],
\end{equation}
where we have defined the ground state energy as zero.  The physical
picture of the process is as follows: in the first term, interaction
with the first pulse through $\alpha_1$ creates a valence
wavepacket. The \emph{retarded} Green's function $G$ is responsible
for \emph{forward} time evolution of the free molecule during the
delay $t_1$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:wpkt}
  \vert \psi( t_1 ) \rangle = G(t_1) \alpha_1 \vert g_o \rangle = \sum_{g'} \alpha_{1;g' g} e^{-i \epsilon_{g'} t_1 }\vert g' \rangle.
\end{equation}
This is finally projected onto the state $\langle g_o \vert \alpha_2$ by the second pulse.  The
valence-excited states which make up the wavepacket in
Eq. \ref{eq:wpkt} can be represented as linear combinations of
particle-hole excitations
\begin{equation}
  \vert g' \rangle = \sum_{ai} C^{g'}_{ai} c^{\dagger}_a c_i \vert g_o \rangle
\end{equation}
where $c^{\dagger}_a$ ($c_i$) is the creation (annihilation) operator
for the virtual (occupied) orbital a (i).  In the second term of Eq. \ref{eq:sxrstime2}, a valence wavepacket
$\alpha_2 \vert g_o \rangle$ is created by the second pulse, the
\emph{advanced} Green's function $G^\dagger$ then propagates it
\emph{backward} during $t_1$ until it is finally projected onto
$\langle g_o \vert \alpha_1^\dagger$ by interaction with pulse 1.
A compact visualization of the particle-hole wavepackets may be obtained by
using natural transition orbitals which represent the reduced single electron particle
and hole density matrix.


Vibrational Raman spectroscopy may be described by expanding the polarizability
perturbatively in the normal modes $Q_i$ of the molecule
\begin{equation}\label{eq:polexpansion}
\alpha = \alpha_0+ \sum_i\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial Q_i} Q_i+ \sum_{i j}\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 \alpha}{\partial Q_i \partial Q_j} Q_i Q_j + \dots
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}\label{eq:modedef}
Q_i=  \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{2 m_i \omega_i}} (a_i{}^{\dagger }+a_i),
\end{equation}
and $a_i$($a_i^{\dagger}$) are
boson creation (annihilation) operators.  Similarly, in x-ray Raman we
can expand the polarizability in the space of valence excitations as
\begin{equation}
\alpha = \alpha_0+ \sum_{i,j}K_{ij} c_i^\dagger c_j + \sum_{i,j,r,s}K_{ijrs} c_i^\dagger c_j c_r^\dagger c_s + \dots
\end{equation}


% Summary Points
\begin{summary}[SUMMARY POINTS]
\begin{enumerate}
\item New x-ray light sources will enable nonlinear spectroscopy of
  core-excitations in molecules.
\item Stimulated X-ray Raman spectroscopies launch and probe valence
  electron wavepackets though core-excited state intermediates.
\item X-ray four wave mixing can reveal coupling between
  core-excited states.
\item Pulse wavevectors, phases, polarizations and  delays can be used
to control the  nonlinear signals.
\end{enumerate}
\end{summary}

% Future Issues
\begin{issues}[FUTURE ISSUES]
\begin{enumerate}
\item More elaborate pulse sequences can be designed to apply the rapidly developing X-ray light source technology to the exploration of fundamental questions regarding many-body interactions in molecular systems.
\item By adapting existing coherent, classical, nonlinear techniques to experiments using quantum and noisy sources, investigators can design new classes of signals, and additional opportunities to measure them with existing XFEL sources will be made possible.
\item Complete control over the phase and amplitude of an intense X-ray pulse would allow sophisticated shaping techniques used in optical and IR spectroscopy to be applied to the X-ray regime.
\item Simulations and experimental studies will be required to apply these techniques to study charge and energy transfer in systems such as photosynthetic complexes, donor-acceptor complexes, and semiconductor excitonic systems.
